      <h1>The Role of Vtubers/Vups in Online Communities</h1>
      </header>

      <p> Vtubers/Vups have gained a massive following in recent years and have created a new and exciting space within online communities.
      The emergence and increasing popularity of Vtubers/Vups are also redefining the online communities. They have provided a new type of interaction between fans and their favorite content creators. By using Live 2D or 3D models and virtual avatars, vtubers are able to engage with their audience in a way that feels more personal, intimate, and interactive than traditional content creators and livestreamers. The absence of real human figures in Vtubing contents somehow makes audience somehow feel more secure.</p>

      <h2>Vtubers have created their own unique online communities. One of the key appeals is the sense of community. These communities are often centered around the personality and content of the vtuber, and are built around shared interests and experiences. Fans often feel a strong connection to their favorite Vtubers, interacting with them and each other through livestream chat and social media. Vtubers also collaborate with each other, creating cross-promotional content that brings together fans from different communities. Vtubers/Vups have also been credited with providing a sense of comfort and escapism during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people were stuck at home.</h2>
