      </header>

      <p> Vtubers/Vups are more than just digital avatars; they are also pushing the boundaries of digital art and interactions. One of the most remarkable aspects of Vtubers is their use of motion capture technology and real-time animation, which allows Vtubers to create highly realistic and expressive performance, blurring the lines between reality and fiction. This has opened up new possibilities for digital art and animation, as well as creating new opportunities for artists and animators to work in the field of virtual entertainment.</p>

      <p>Vtubers create unique experiences for their fans, such as in-game collaborations and virtual concerts. Some of them also use augmented reality and virtual reality technologies to create immersive experiences for their fans.</p>

       <h2> Vtubing is becoming a new form of narrative. Not only visual elements, but 中の人's role playing contribute to their digital performance. 中の人 refers to person who is inside a kigurumi costume or, by extension, person behind something in Japanese. Vtubers/Vups' voices, the ways and tones they talk, and online contents they make are aiming to support their backstories, characteristics, and personalities, much like what traditional character design does but in a new performance approach that is digital and real-time.</h2>
